# Player Service

Let's play some music! We'll be creating a service that wraps the html5 audio API, and plays a track when a track row is
clicked. There's a little bit of trickery to setup the audio element, so check out the offical API documentation:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio. There's a unit test for the player service as well as
an integration test that clicks a track row and ensures that the track is playing.
