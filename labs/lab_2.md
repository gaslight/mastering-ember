# Converting to Ember Data

Now, we'll convert our `artists` route to use Ember Data to fetch artists from the server. Run `git chechout lab-2`,
and visit [localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests). You'll see that our acceptance test is failing because
it's expecting to receive data from the server. Update the appropriate route to fetch the artists list from the server
and make the tests pass.
