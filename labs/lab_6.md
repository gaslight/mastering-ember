# Track Row Component

So far we've built the major pieces for our app. Users are able to view artists, albums and tracks. Now it's time to add
some interactivity! We'll start by creating a component to handle interactions with each track. Let's start by handling
a click action that updates the track row to show that it's playing. There is an integration test for an me-track-row
component that will guide you though.
