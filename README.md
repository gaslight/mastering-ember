# Mastering Ember

# Prerequisites

During the Mastering Ember course, we'll be using [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) to develop our Ember
application. We'll also be using [git](git-scm.com) to maintain our source code. This will walk you through installing
Node, ember-cli and bower and git.

## 1. Install Node

### on OSX

The best way to install node on OSX is via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Install homebrew and run:

    brew install node

### on Windows

Execute the node installer at [https://nodejs.org/en/#download](https://nodejs.org/en/#download)

## 2. Install ember-cli

    npm install -g ember-cli

## 3. Install bower

    npm install -g bower

## 4. Install git

If you already have git installed and are comfortable with git and, feel free to skip this step.

The easiest way to install git is by installing [GitHub Destop](https://desktop.github.com/). Please follow the
installation instructions there.


To check that the necessary packages are installed, you should see the following output (or something similar) in
the terminal.

    > ember --version
    version: 1.13.8
    ...

    > bower --version
    1.x.x

    > git --version
    git version 2.x.x
